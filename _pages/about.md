I am a mathematician who specializes in machine learning and has a great love for answering questions with data. I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics and learning more about problem solving, leadership, and my fellow human beings every day. I have particular interest in the field of Data Science and believe that getting data to work for the good of the world is an invaluable way to give back to my community. 

I also love creating and listening to music, playing basketball, or getting lost in a great book.
