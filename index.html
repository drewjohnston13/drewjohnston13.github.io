    title: "Data Science Computing Specialist (2020)"
    excerpt: 'I worked with a small team of data scientists to develop end-to-end data pipelines for BYU Enrollment Services.
    We worked to track student success within each Major degree program and statistically identify optimal Major Milestones
    for student success. This was a time of huge growth for me as we were given little established architecture and free reign
    to organize code and develop models as seemed best. This resulted in heavy research and trial-and-error that proved to be 
    invaluable experience for me.'

    excerpt: 'I participated in the summer REU in Data Mining at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington in 2019. 
    The NSF-funded REU gave me the opportunity to work closely with supervising professors to develop and test novel features
    for detecting atrial fibrillation using electrocardiogram data. I learned a lot about conducting research in unfamiliar
    fields, collaborating in a professional environment, and writing and presenting academic research. Read my report on the 
    subject to learn more about our research!'

    excerpt: 'I worked with a small team to validate proprietary metrics for stock prediction using machine learning techniques.
    We went on to combine in-house data with data from BYUâ€™s Bloomberg terminal to identify features to be used in anomaly 
    detection for growth-based portfolio investment strategies. If leveraged correctly, such features can save an investment 
    firm billions in the case of large economic upheaval. It was exciting to learn about and implement my own machine learning
    models on real data for the first time. It opened my eyes to the difficulties of such data and the work that goes into
    data cleaning and munging.'
